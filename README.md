# TacoNutri

This project is necessary to the final exam from the course of Software Design and Development from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte. It may have poorly organized or written code, since i'm new to web development with Grails and design patterns.

The course covers topics on Database relational modelling, SQL and UML Diagrams.

The goal of this project is to facilitate the communication between nutritionists and their pacients by making custom diets easier to share and monitor for both parts. It will be based on TACO (Tabela Brasileira de Composição de Alimentos - Available here: http://www.unicamp.br/nepa/taco/).
